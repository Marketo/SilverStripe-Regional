# SilverStripe-Regional
Using modern GeoIP lookup mechanisms, this SilverStripe module makes available the coordinates, postal code, city, state, country, content, timezone, organization, and ISP to the SilverStripe instance and can open a frontend API for static websites to take advantage of. It can be extended with GeoIP drivers to provide additional or custom contextual data.
